# Vaccine-usage-Prediction
Problem Statement – Logistic Regression

Abstract:

Subjects receiving the same vaccine often show different levels of immune responses
and some may even present adverse side effects to the vaccine. Systems vaccinology can
combine omics data and machine learning techniques to obtain highly predictive
signatures of vaccine immunogenicity and reactogenicity. Currently, several machine
learning methods are already available to researchers with no background in
bioinformatics.
Problem Statement:
Predict how likely it is that the people will take an H1N1 flu vaccine using Logistic
Regression.



Scope:
● Exploratory data analysis
● Data Pre-processing
● Training logistic regression model with MLE and SGD for prediction



Learning Outcome:
Get a better understanding of how the variables are linked to each
other and how the EDA approach will help them gain more insights and knowledge
about the data that we have and train Logistic Regression using with MLE and SGD.
